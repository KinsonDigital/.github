<h1 align="center">Branching</h1>

This project uses a simple branching model.  It illustrates a clear purpose for adding features and releases.

As a standard contributor, all you have to worry about is creating <span style="color: #66B2FF;font-weight:bold">feature</span> branches and creating pull requests to merge those branches into the <span style="color: #82B366;font-weight:bold">master</span> branch.  The rest is taken care of by a solid CI/CD system as well as the maintainers of the project.  Only the organization owner and designated team members will manage the release process.  So, contributing is very easy!!ðŸ¥³
