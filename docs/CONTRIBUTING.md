<h1 style="border:0;font-weight:bold" align="center">Contribution Guide</h1>

Hello!!  Thanks for your interest in contributing to our project!!  Any help you can provide is greatly appreciated.  We are always looking for ways to make the contribution process as simple and as straightforward as possible. In addition, we want to make sure that the required workflow and development processes are followed in order to maintain high software quality. If you have any ideas and/or comments on how to simplify the process for outside contributors, please don't hesitate to contact one of the project maintainers.

You can contribute to our projects with issues and PRs. Creating GitHub issues for problems you encounter and code contribution are other ways to help out and are greatly appreciated!

When contributing with an issue, please only use the issues with the description that says _**(Outside contributors only)**_.  The rest of the issues are used by project maintainers.  

**Considerations:**

Only the **KinsonDigital** team will merge changes that improve the library significantly. We will not merge changes that have narrowly-defined benefits or are breaking in any way. All contributions must also follow all other guidelines outlined in this document.

<h2 style="border:0;font-weight:bold" align="center">DO's and DON'Ts</h2>

**Please:**

- **DO** follow the [code of conduct](https://github.com/KinsonDigital/.github/docs/code_of_conduct.md) on GitHub.
- **DO** follow the `ðŸ“ƒrules` on [Discord](https://discord.gg/qewu6fNgv7).
- **DO** talk to us on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/qewu6fNgv7) server.
- **DO** keep issue discussions around contributions focused.
- **DO** use the comment sections in the issues and pull requests (PRs) that are relevant to said issues and PRs.  This not only keeps conversations contained in the issues and PRs, it sends notifications to the project maintainers, and shows the conversation to the community/public.
- **DO** leave a comment in the issue that you are interested in to let the project maintainers know that you would like to work on the issue.
- **DON'T** start working on a PR until you get confirmation from a project maintainer and the issue is assigned to you.  We do not want to waste your time on an issue that you are not allowed to work on.
- **DON'T** make PRs that don't directly affect the end user, such as style changes. These are best done as part of a PR related to the area in question. Documentation is fine (and encouraged!), as is useful to the end user.
- **DO** follow [branch naming requirements and practices](https://github.com/KinsonDigital/.github/blob/master/docs/Branching.md).
- **DO** create PRs with the title that matches **EXACTLY** to the associated issue's title.  PRs with mismatching titles will not pass status checks and cannot be merged.
- **DO** use [pull request templates](https://github.com/KinsonDigital/.github/tree/master/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE) when creating PRs.  Pull requests without a PR template will not be merged.
- **DO** use [Early Pull Requests](https://medium.com/practical-blend/pull-request-first-f6bb667a9b6).
- **DON'T** commit code you didn't write without following its own license and without following our guidelines in the Contributor License Agreement. If you are unable to license code, don't commit it.
- **DON'T** surprise us with big PRs or big API changes without talking to us first!
- **DON'T** make PRs for legal or administrative documents, such as the license, file headers, or code of conduct. If something is off, let us know and we will look into changing it.

<h2 style="border:0;font-weight:bold" align="center">Breaking Changes</h2>

Contributions must maintain API signature and behavioral compatibility. Contributions that include breaking changes MUST be discussed with project maintainers first. Breaking changes are subject to the team's approval. At risk of sounding like a broken record, talk to us about your idea first!

<h2 style="border:0;font-weight:bold" align="center">Setting Things Up</h2>

For first-time contributors, you need to fork the repository so you can contribute.  There are a few steps that you will need to go through to start contributing.  Go [here](https://github.com/KinsonDigital/.github/blob/master/docs/HowToFork.md) to follow the steps on forking the repository.  There are lot's of resources on the web on what forking is and how to do this.

<h2 style="border:0;font-weight:bold" align="center">Branching</h2>

The projects in the KinsonDigital organization have different branching models.  Refer to the branching model list below to get pointed to the correct branching model documentation for that branching model.

1. [Branching Model 1](https://github.com/KinsonDigital/.github/blob/master/docs/BranchingModel1.md)
   > **Note** This is the most complicated branching model used with some of the projects.  This gives projects such as [Velaptor](https://github.com/KinsonDigital/Velaptor) and [CASL](https://github.com/KinsonDigital/CASL) maximum control over changes and CICD to make sure that breaking changes do not end up in production.  This branch is like GitFlow but with the added ability to deal with preview releases.
2. [Branching Model 2](https://github.com/KinsonDigital/.github/blob/master/docs/BranchingModel2.md)
   > **Note** This is the simplest branching model.  The projects that use this model is the [Velaptor Documentation](https://github.com/KinsonDigital/VelaptorDocs) website and all of the GitHub actions.

---

Our projects follow a strict naming policy. The purpose is for clarity and consistency, and it helps bind the information between GIT and GitHub. It also allows our CI/CD system to perform its job by validating issues and PRs using status checks.

Please make sure that you take the time and verify that the branch name is correct.  Branch names must be all lower case and the issue number in the branch name must be a valid GitHub issue number.  If the branch naming syntax, casing, or issue number is incorrect, the status checks for the CI/CD system will detect this and prevent the PR from being merged.

Of course, we are all human and people make mistakes!!  This is ok and no harm is done.  If you do accidentally create a PR with a head(source) branch name that is incorrect, tag a maintainer in the PR about the mistake and recreate the PR.  If for some reason you used the incorrect base(target) branch, the PR does not have to be recreated.  You should be able to edit the the base(target) branch because you are the author of the PR.

* Go [here](https://github.com/KinsonDigital/.github/blob/master/docs/CreatingModel1Branches.md) to follow instructions on how to create a contribution branch for projects that follow [Branching Model 1](https://github.com/KinsonDigital/.github/blob/master/docs/BranchingModel1.md)
* Go [here](https://github.com/KinsonDigital/.github/blob/master/docs/CreatingModel1Branches.md) to follow instructions on how to create a contribution branch for projects that follow [Branching Model 2](https://github.com/KinsonDigital/.github/blob/master/docs/BranchingModel2.md)

<h2 style="border:0;font-weight:bold" align="center">Creating Early Pull Requests</h2>

Refer to the **DO's and DON'Ts** section for details about PRs.

We encourage and use [Early Pull Requests](https://medium.com/practical-blend/pull-request-first-f6bb667a9b6). Please don't wait until you're finished with your work before creating a PR!  Go [here](https://github.com/KinsonDigital/.github/blob/master/docs/EarlyPullrequests.md) to learn how to create an early pull request.


<h2 style="border:0;font-weight:bold" align="center">"Help wanted" & "Good first issue"</h2>

If the core team is unable to champion an issue, they will mark it with a "help wanted" label. This indicates that any external contributor may pick it up and implement it as part of a contribution. However, some **"help wanted"** issues may require intermediate knowledge of the codebase, area, and/or ecosystem; or may have uncertainty surrounding implementation details.  If this is the case, talk to us in [Discord](https://discord.gg/qewu6fNgv7) or in the issue's discussion. We also mark some issues with the label **"good first issue"** which indicates that an issue is straightforward and is a good place to start if you're interested in contributing but are new to the codebase.
