      Reasons for local unit test execution:
      - Unit tests might pass locally but not in the CI environment during the status check process or vice-versa.
      - Tests might pass on the developer's machine but not necessarily on the code reviewer's machine.
      </details>

      **_<details closed><summary>Version Updating</summary>_**
      
      The version can be updated by setting the values of the `<Version/>` and `<FileVersion/>` XML tags in the project file.
      The `<Version/>` and `<FileVersion/>` values can hold production and preview releases.
      The `<AssemblyVersion/>` XML tag can only hold production values.  Preview values are not allowed.

      ``` xml
      <!--Preview Release Example-->
      <Version>1.2.3-preview.4</Version>
      <FileVersion>1.2.3-preview.4</FileVersion>
      <AssemblyVersion>1.2.3</AssemblyVersion>
      ```

      Version changes should be committed to a _**prev-release**_ head branch for the the pull request linked to this issue.
