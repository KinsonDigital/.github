      Reasons for local unit test execution:
      - Unit tests might pass locally but not in the CI environment during the status check process or vice-versa.
      - Tests might pass on the developer's machine but not necessarily on the code reviewer's machine.

      **_<details closed><summary>Version Updating</summary>_**
      
      The version can be updated by setting the values of the `<Version/>` and `<FileVersion/>` XML tags in the project file.

      ``` xml
      <!--Syntax for preview releases-->
      <Version>1.2.3-preview.4</Version>
      <FileVersion>1.2.3-preview.4</FileVersion>

      ```
      </details>

      ---

      **_<details closed><summary>Release Notes</summary>_**

      The release notes go into the appropriate folder:
      - **Preview Release Notes** go into the **_~/Documentation/ReleaseNotes/PreviewReleases_** folder.

      Release note file names must follow a particular syntax and are in markdown format so they can be added to the release.

      #### Release Notes File Name Syntax:
      - **Preview Release Notes:**
        - **Syntax:** Release-Notes-v\<_major_\>.\<_minor_\>.\<_patch_\>-preview.\<_prev-num_\>.md
        - **Example:** Release-Notes-v1.0.0-preview.4.md

      Changes such as release notes and version updates should be committed to the same source branch in the pull request attached to this issue.
      </details>
