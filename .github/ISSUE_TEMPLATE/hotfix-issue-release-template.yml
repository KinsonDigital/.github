      **_<details closed><summary>HotFix Purpose</summary>_**

      The purpose of a hotfix is to release a fix to something wrong to production as soon as possible.
      This concept should be treated very carefully.  This should only happen if the software is simply broken and
      _**UNUSABLE**_.  If there is a simple workaround or the issue is minor, then a hotfix should not be required.

      A hotfix should be a rare occasion and if it has been occurring often, then the development and release process
      should be reviewed for improvements to try and help prevent a hotfix from occurring.
      </details>

      ---

      **_<details closed><summary>Unit Tests</summary>_**
      
      Reasons for local unit test execution:
      - Unit tests might pass locally but not in the CI environment during the status check process or vice-versa.
      - Tests might pass on the developer's machine but not necessarily on the code reviewer's machine.
      </details>

      ---

      **_<details closed><summary>Version Updating</summary>_**
      
      The version can be updated by setting the values of the `<Version/>` and `<FileVersion/>` XML tags in the project file.
      The `<Version/>` and `<FileVersion/>` values can hold production and preview releases.
      The `<AssemblyVersion/>` XML tag can only hold production values.  Preview values are not aloud.

      NOTE: This is a hotfix so a preview release version is not aloud.

      ``` xml
      <!--Production Release Example-->
      <Version>1.2.3</Version>
      <FileVersion>1.2.3</FileVersion>
      <AssemblyVersion>1.2.3</AssemblyVersion>
      ```
      </details>

      ---

      **_<details closed><summary>Release Notes</summary>_**

      By default, the release notes go into a **_ReleaseNotes_** folder inside of the **_Documentation_** folder with the **_Documentation_** folder at the root of the repository.
      Production release notes path: **_./Documentation/ReleaseNotes/ProductionReleases_**.

      Release note file names must follow a particular syntax and are in markdown format so they can be added to the release.

      #### Release Notes File Name Syntax:
      - **Production Release Notes:**
        - **Syntax:** Release-Notes-v#.#.#.md
        - **Example:** Release-Notes-v1.2.3.md

      Changes such as release notes and version updates should be committed to the destination branch (master) in the pull request attached to this issue.
      </details>
